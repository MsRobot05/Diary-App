Digital Dignity

Type in public. Stay private.

Digital Dignity is a secure text editor designed for the modern world where privacy is scarce. Whether you are in a coffee shop, on a train, or in a shared office, this tool ensures your digital thoughts remain private.

As you type, the characters on the screen are automatically encrypted into randomized text. A bystander looking at your screen will only see gibberish, while the actual content is safely stored in memory. Only the owner (you) can reveal the true text.

🌟 Key Features

👁️ Anti-Shoulder Surfing: Input is instantly obfuscated. Hello World appears as X7f#9L... on screen immediately.

🔒 Zero-Knowledge Display: The raw text is never rendered in the DOM unless you explicitly trigger the "Reveal" function.

⚡ Instant Privacy: Perfect for drafting emails, messages, or sensitive notes in crowded public spaces.
